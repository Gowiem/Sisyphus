    <h2>Through our own experiences and a survey of 195 students, we have found that group projects are broken: organization is diﬃcult, individuals never have an equal amount of work, and everyone receives the same grade.</h2>

  <h2>Signifcant Research Results</h2>
  </br>
  <p>Students are most frustrated when certain  group members not doing their work. Unexpectedly, 0 of the 195 students surveyed felt that “earning their grade” was most important when it came to group projects. Faculty interviews revealed that teachers do not have time to check in with groups.</p>

  <h2>Concept</h2>
  </br>
  <p>Our concept is a website to facilitate group projects. Faculty users create and monitor group projects, define project goals, and assign groups. Students can then create, assign, complete, dispute, and comment on tasks.</p>
